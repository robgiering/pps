    Hi!  My name is Amy Clark and I will be the person responding to all phone calls, emails and text messages Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.  I ensure that our Pet Care provider’s schedules flow smoothly and the needs of our client’s and their pets are taken care of.

    I have been owned and loved by animals for my entire life. I have owned a variety of pets including barn animals, horses, cats, dogs, rats, reptiles, gerbils, hamsters, guinea pigs, rabbits, hermit crabs, birds, fish, etc. The only critter I am not comfortable with is SPIDERS!
</p>
<p class="text-muted">
    For years I spent a lot of time involved in training and showing dogs.  It was a ton of fun but also a huge time commitment, especially on the weekends.  As my children started to get busy in sports on the weekends, I decided to give up my hobby for the time being so I could be there to support them.
</p>
<p class="text-muted">
    The thing I love best about pet sitting is that no matter what kind of day I am having, animals always make my day better!

    I’m originally from Dearborn MI. I have always loved visiting my grandparents farm near Midland where I learned to care for their dogs, cats and sheep and they even had a goose when I was little.  I love nature and all animals so it’s great to now live in the Midland area.

    My first experience with pets was when I was about 6 or 7 and my parents got me a guinea pig. That was followed by many more guinea pigs and then I got my first dog about 30 years ago and I haven’t been “dogless” since. We currently have 3 dogs and 3 cats and I love spending time with them! I don’t know who looks more forward to our daily walks, me or the dogs?
</p>
<p class="text-muted">
    I look forward to meeting you and spending quality time with your pets!

    Hello, my name is John and I provide pet sitting, dog walking, overnight house sitting, and vacation services.  I started my love of animals at a young age when my family bought a cat, and then later another cat. After some time I got a beautiful dog, and with all these animals I truly found the joy of such loyal companions. I currently have just one cat who enthusiastically bounds around on his 3 legs and bumps into things sometimes with his one eye.  As a fellow lover of all animals I am thrilled to be able to meet, care for, and enjoy the company of your special guy or gal.
